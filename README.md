# Hangman
This is a project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Ruby curriculum. The specs of the project can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/hangman).

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional hangman game that will allow the player to save their current game and then let them decided to load it when the game is re-opened. If the player loads a previous game and wins or loses that save file will be deleted. They will also be asked if they would like to overwrite their previous save if they decide to save their game and a save file is detected.

## How to Play
The game can be played online on Replit.

If you would like to play it locally you will need Ruby installed. You can then clone the repository and run the main.rb file in the top-level directory.
